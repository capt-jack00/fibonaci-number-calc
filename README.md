# Fibonaci number calculator
This is simple program that calculates numbers in fibonaci's sequence. It is one of many programs written in C++ on my learning path.
(for now program is only able to calculate even numbers lenght, while trying to calculate number 11 numbers long may be causing errors or it may work anyways but not as intended)
